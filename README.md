# Capstone
Capstone project for LC's LC101

#Overview:
This project will be a simple, yet concise, job or school application tracker.
Users will be able to input the details regarding a job or school application,
allowing for an easier way to track todos, follow-ups, sites that posted the job,
etc. Instead of attempting to remember the several job or school websites, the 
tracker will provide all of the information and reminders in one location. 

While searching for my first post-college job, I found managing the different 
job hunting websites to be time-consuming and unnecessary...inspiring this 
small project. 

#Features:
1) User login leading to that individual's home page listing their jobs / schools
2) Ability for user to add, edit, remove jobs / schools to their list
3) Ability for user to add a link to the original job website for easy access

4) Look into allowing user to set reminders that are sent to their email?
5) Mapping the locations of the jobs and proximity to home location?
6) Marking jobs/schools as turned down, moved on to interview, or other steps?
7) Ability to sort jobs by certain categories

8) Ability to share jobs with friends? Make it more social? 

#Technologies:
1) Java
2) Spring Boot
3) Gradle 
4) Tomcat
5) Thymeleaf templates
6) Bootstrap or HTML/CSS
7) MySQL
8) IntelliJ IDEA

#Must Learn
Possibly add some JavaScript features during the design process. Any connection with email, maps, 
or data from another API will need to be learned. Learn more about Spring Boot, validation, and 
deployment of the web application. I'm sure I will learn much more than listed here :)!
